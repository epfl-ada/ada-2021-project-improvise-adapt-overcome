# Conclusion

As hypothesized, we find some meaningful clusters by linking journals together by the individuals they cite. By closer inspection of the top speakers, top journals, quote semantics and key words, we are able to identify what defines these groups and to provide useful insight for analysing quotebank. We could for example use this datastory to indentify that analysing gender bias in the celebrity cluster would be a good idea.
