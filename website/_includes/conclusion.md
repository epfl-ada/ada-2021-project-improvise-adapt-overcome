# Conclusion

As hypothesized, we found some meaningful clusters by linking journals together by the individuals they cite. By closer inspection of the top speakers, top journals, quote semantics and key words, it becomes straightforward to label each cluster and understand the category of topics and individuals it englobes.

## Insight into the United States
As a majority of journals included in Quotebank are related to the United States, the groupings related to the country gives us a good insight into American culture. If we make the assumption that media covers the most popular areas of interest of the local population, we can deduce popular aspects of US life. Aside from politics, we observe that religion and celebrities may hold close to the US population. Furthermore, there is a large interest in sports; notably, American football, Basketball, Hockey, Golf, Baseball, and motorsports. We can also infer some of the nation's most popular/known individuals or best athletes by looking at the top speakers. For example, maybe Tiger Woods is one of the best golfers, being number 1 in the "Golf" group. Finally, we can also guess that New York and California are important geographic locations of the country, as they each have a dedicated cluster. Using this information, one can likely use Quotebank to analyze life and politics in the United States due to the abundance of quotes related to the country.

## Donald Trump
Amazingly, Donald Trump is prevalent in many of our groups. In the "religion" cluster, he is even the second most quoted individual, after Pope Francis himself! He has dominated political discussion in the United States for 2020 with around 7% of quotes attributed to him in our "US politics" grouping, with his presidential opponent Joe Biden trailing in second with less than 2% of quotes in comparison. Locally (in our New York and California state groupings) he remains in the top 3 cited individuals with around 3% of quotes. Finally, it seems Trump is also popular in the media internationally, as he once again appears in the 10 most cited individuals in our journal groupings for Ireland (4th with ~2%), Australia (10th with ~1%), UK (3rd with ~1.5%), India (2nd with ~3%), and Canada (2nd with ~2.5%). Once again, the abundance of quotes attributed to Donald Trump would likely allow a thorough analysis of his opinions or political stance using Quotebank.
