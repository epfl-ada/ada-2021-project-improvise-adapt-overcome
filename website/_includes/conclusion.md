# Conclusion

As hypothesized, we found some meaningful clusters by linking journals together by the individuals they cite. By closer inspection of the top speakers, top journals, quote semantics and key words, it becomes straightforward to label each cluster and understand the category of topics and individuals it englobes. From the journal groupings we generated, we can make the following observations on the Quotebank dataset:

## (Logically) English-speaking media

## Insight into the United States
Ã  paufiner mais, As a majority of journals included in Quotebank are related to the United States, the groupings related to the country gives us a good insight into American culture. If we make the assumption that media covers the most popular areas of interest of the local population, we can deduce popular aspects of US life. Aside from politics, we observe that religion and celebrities may hold close to the US population. Furthermore, there is a large interest in sports; notably, American football, Basketball, Hockey, Golf, Baseball, and motorsports. Finally, we can also guess that New York and California are important geographic locations of the country, as they each have a dedicated cluster. 

## Donald Trump
Amazingly, Donald Trump is prevalent in many of our groups (QUANTIFIER).
