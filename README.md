# Project outline

## Title

Communities in news outlets, reporters and speakers

## Abstract

The goal of the project is to highlight relationships between newspapers, journalists and interviewees.
More precisely, we want to construct a graph between these entities based on different factors:
interviewed, cited, stories reported on, ... This will enable us to detect communities and draw
interesting conclusions.

## Research questions

- Are there any newspapers that reports on similar stories ?
- Is someone regularly interviewed by some journals but not others ?
- Do newspapers cite local experts ?
- If there are groups of news outlets, what attributes define them ?

## Additional datasets

- Wikidata, for geographical information about Quotebank's entities
- A dataset of connecting words, to filter them out when trying to extract the topic out of a quote

## Methods

- Graph community detection
- Graph database (?)

## Timeline

- [12.11] Start the project
- [19.11] Create graph model
- [26.11] Community detection
- [10.12] Visualizations/data story

## Team organization

Team preferences:

- Julian: experimenting with page rank
- Luca: visualisations and geographic analysis
- Sylvain: tooling, technologies

## Questions for TAs

- Office hours ? Are we just supposed to show up Friday ? How much time do we have ?
- Graph creation: what is the correct method ?
- Any tools to do community detection ?
- Concerns on feasibility ?
